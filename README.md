#OzoneWeather
  
A simple weather app that encorporates UV and ozone data from [TEMIS](http://www.temis.nl). Also calculates sunrise, sunset, solar noon, current and forecast hourly UV index, and time to vitamin D. The time to vitamin D is calculated for a person with European type II skin, with 25% of skin surface exposed -- a t-shirt and pants -- synthesizing roughly 1000 IU of vitamin D. 

**Please note:** The Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service (TEMIS) ozone service no longer lists terms of service on their website. Please contact them if you wish to incorporate this data stream in a released product.   

###Sources and references:

This app is base on the tutorial: [SimpleWeather](http://www.raywenderlich.com/55384/ios-7-best-practices-part-1). 

The TEMIS data is parsed using `libxml2` and `Hpple`,  based on another tutorial [how to parse HTML on iOS](http://www.raywenderlich.com/14172/how-to-parse-html-on-ios).
